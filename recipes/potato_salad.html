        <h2>A Mustard Potato Salad Recipe</h2>
        <p>There are about as many potato salad recipes as there are women in the South. Though I was reared in the south, I was brought up by a North Dakotan. Maybe that explains the big chunks of potato and celery and the copious amounts of mustard. Either way, its my favorite, and the favorite of many who have had the chance to try it. Enjoy!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <div>
        <ul>
