    <h2>My kids' favorite mac and cheese!</h2>
    <p>This recipe for homemade mac and cheese is, to put it plainly, quite rich. Some of the ingredients seem a bit odd. It was years before I ever even tried the recipe, which I copied from an old Great Plains cookbook that my mom has had for decades. TRUST ME - JUST TRY IT. All other mac & cheese pales in comparison!</p>
